mapping elements with mapper
only not null collections are moved to hibernate entity (and when collection is not on "embeded" parameter list,
it is not returned, so should be send from client as null => this means collection should not be modifed)
when empty collection is send (empty table) it will be cleared (all elements will be deleted) on server side
